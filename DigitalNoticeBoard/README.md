# Digital-noticeboard
In this project there are only users and Admin who only belong to University at Albany. 
A customer would be able to sign up only if his email has domain "******@albany.edu" So if you are trying to sign up as gmail user,Sorry we are not processing users out of University at Albany. 
But if you belong to UAlbany, 
Very Warm Welcome to Digital Notice Board !

Once signed up with Ualbany email User will be sent an automatic validation email for Digital Notice Board !

Once the email is validated, you can start using our application by signing in with your credentials that you just created! You would be able to see all the notices on public channels,If you want to be in group you should be invited into it through your email but if you just want to use our application for public information , you don't have to be in any group.

You can also create a group on your own , you can be admin of it where only the admin would be posting the notices, deleting the notices Removing the users from group Deleting inappropriate notices in the group Many like that

We do have many notice applications? How is this project different from the existed one ? Have you got this doubt??

We are here to clarify that We do have a unique feature i.e expired notices are longer visible , which means they are automatically deleted even from the database after the expiration time which means, the information that you see is updated every second, every minute, every hour ! ISN'T Cool ? Yes right !!

Do you want to setup our application on your local ? Sure! Why not !

Go to the folder where you wish to save this project.

Go to command prompt

TYPE: git clone https://github.com/Vijay-yeruva/DigitalNoticeBoard.git

you should be able to clone it successfully Once cloned,open your IDE We used Eclipse , Visual Studio while developing the application.
